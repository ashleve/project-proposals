## Python beginner projects
For AI/ML projects it's required to have basic python experience.

Projects useful for learning python:
- Swarm simulation - organic motion from 3 simple rules

    Difficulty: 3/5

    Algorithm explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw

    Recommended library for animation: OpenCV. See the [example animation](.resources/BOIDS.md).

- Simple streamlit dashboard

    Difficulty: 2/5

    Streamlit is an extremely simple tool for building interactive data visualisation web apps. Very useful for interacting with AI models and building demos.

    You can use it to build anything you want, for example gitub profile activity dashboard or statistics dashboard for you twitter account.

    See the examples from official gallery: https://streamlit.io/gallery
