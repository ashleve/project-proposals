# AI/ML Projects

The AI/ML projects require basic python experience as well as basic Machine Learning knowledge.

The ML framework recommended for projects is either PyTorch or Keras. Pytorch is more low level and may be a better choice if you want to fully understand the learning process, while Keras is very high level and automates a lot of things for you (the tradeoff is it's less flexible).


## MNIST/FashionMNIST/CIFAR10 image classifier

Description: Machine Learning model which learns to classify images. MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR10 are small and fast to train toy image datasets.
